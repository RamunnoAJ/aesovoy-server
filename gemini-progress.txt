Accomplished:

- Verified changes with existing tests and added new integration tests for Identity Fields.

Tests Completed:
- internal/billing: TestListInvoices
- internal/store: TestDuplicateIdentityFields, TestDuplicateIdentityFieldsProviders

Next Steps:
- **Order List Improvements:** Default 7-day filter and descending sort.
- Order Payment Management (Paid status, Payment Method).

Status: All tests passing.
