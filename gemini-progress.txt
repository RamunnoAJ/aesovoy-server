Session Date: Friday, December 19, 2025

Accomplished:
- Added Fullstack Pagination for Invoices.
- Backend: Verified `billing.ListInvoices` logic with new tests in `internal/billing/billing_test.go`.
- API: Added `GET /api/v1/invoices` JSON endpoint with pagination metadata.
- Frontend: Improved `invoices_list.html` pagination controls to preserve `date` filter.
- Security: Restricted `/invoices` web routes to Administrators only.
- Fix: Resolved compilation error in `internal/api/invoice_handler.go` (undefined `renderJSON`).
- Verified all changes with `go test`.

Tests Completed:
- internal/billing: TestListInvoices (New)

Next Steps:
- Continue with other features from `feature_list.json` if any are pending (currently all marked as true, but new requests might come).
- Maybe add frontend tests (Puppeteer) for the invoice page.

Status: All tests passing.
