The `providers_list.html` template was updated:
- Fixed an `unexpected EOF` error by adding a closing `{{end}}` tag for the `{{define "content"}}` block.
- Changed the "Agregar Categoría" button's color to blue (`bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700`) to match other "Nuevo" buttons.
- Refactored the "Editar" and "Eliminar" action buttons for provider categories into a dropdown menu, consistent with the existing dropdown pattern used for providers.
These changes improve the UI consistency and fix a template rendering error.
